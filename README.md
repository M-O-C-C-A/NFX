# NetflixVisionPro


Welcome to the future of entertainment with Vision Pro, the pioneering prototype app developed on Apple's visionary platform, visionOS. As an individual SwiftUI developer, I am thrilled to present this immersive Netflix clone exclusively designed for Vision Pro. Harnessing the power of the newly announced (just 5 days ago) visionOS SDK, this app showcases the cutting-edge possibilities of mixed reality technology.

Immerse yourself in a mesmerizing world of captivating space scenes, volumetric experiences, and breathtaking visual effects, powered by the latest advancements in SwiftUI with the enhanced AVKit representable video player.
